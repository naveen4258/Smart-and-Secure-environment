# Smart-and-Secure-environment

Now a days massive gathering area like shopping malls, movie theatres and etc. are becoming very familiar in urban or semi urban areas. Most of the shopping mall, Movie theatres are in Multi-storied building. The authorities must maintain proper measures to ensure proper public safety and security of visitors. When there is no system in place to ensure security and safety of visitors, it may lead to disastrous situations. There are several reasons which hinders security and safety of visitors of such buildings. The emergence of Internet of Things, the ideas of Smart Buildings, Smart Homes, Smart Environment etc. have been conceived. The popularization of smart building technology redefines redefine the way various tasks are executed work and the way the people live at present and in future. The concept of Smartness is majorly applied to reduce human intervention in various control operations and reduce electricity consumption in buildings as well as in other operational environment. But mass gatherings are happened in multistoried buildings like Shopping Malls, movie theatres, safety and security of visitors as a major area of concern. In the proposed problem, an attempt is made to enforce a mechanism that helps authorities to have continuous monitoring on movements of all visitors as well as continuous monitoring on various operational equipment like Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioners (HVAC). This system also helps in preventive maintenance of HVAC equipment. This proposed project has the following features
	Assigning RFID tag to each visitor. This helps in recording the following 
	Inflow and Outflow
Visitor will get an RFID tag while entering a building, the same visitor has to submit the RFID while he/she is leaving the building
	No: of visitors per day
	Average time spent by a visitor
	Security analysis at the end of the day. (during closing time)
	Forecasting visitors count on daily basis based on historical data using Machine Learning model to have a plan for specific day.
	Tracking suspected Individuals based on his/her presence in the building
	Maintaining suitable environment in the building based on visitors count.  
	Preventive Maintenance of HVAC Systems inside a building
	Heating 
	Ventilation
	Air condition maintenance
	Health of a Building:
	Calculating the effective load on the building (floor wise) using Vibration sensors
The same solution can be applied at other places where large number of people gather for special purposes.  e.g. Pilgrimage Places, Schools/colleges, Government/ Commercial Offices, Hospitals, Power Plants etc.

Advantages: The proposed solution is a light weight solution, since it does not require much processing power like in Camera based Surveillance methods.
